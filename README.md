Whisper starts off kind of funny, I don't know how, but it took the name "Stanley Zupnick" and
transcribed it as "Stan Lee Zupnick". I guess it has a lot of Marvel Comics-based training data somehow if
the reward function decided to spit out "Stan Lee". Other than that, it seemed to almost entirely get the rest of the video
correct, which was great to see. It got the sentence structure correct
