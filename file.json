{"text": " Today is a great day. Why? Because today is Stan Lee Zupnick Day. This is a great moment not only for our engineering school, the Clark School, but the entire university and the surrounding community. This is a great investment. It's a great investment that the state is happy to be involved with because it's going to change lives. It's going to change the way we live, the generations live. Zupnick Hall will be a new place for engineering students to call home, a place to learn, to grow, and for students to meet and inspire one another. To emulate the Terrapin, stick our necks out and keep moving forward. Achieving that ambition means creating an environment that's right for innovation, collaboration, diversity, inclusion, where engineers and non-engineers synergistically connect to find solutions at work. Education remains the most potent force in our country to change lives. By bringing together different departments and centers, our already stellar engineering curriculum will become even stronger. This is one more fantastic addition as we continue to build out the capital of quantum. This new building is the last piece of the Clark Foundation's building together investment at the university and it's a wonderful capstone to our partnership with Maryland. Together our investments will cultivate the next generation of engineering leaders. Today, more than ever, our students and engineers in general must have vision. It is my hope that this new space will make it easier to exchange ideas. Having such dedicated friends and partners is a big reason why I'm optimistic about where our campus is today and where it's headed in our future. Three, two, one. It's not enough to just be fearless anymore. We also have to move fearlessly forward.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 7.84, "text": " Today is a great day. Why?
