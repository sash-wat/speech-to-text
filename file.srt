00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,840
Today is a great day. Why? Because today is Stan Lee Zupnick Day. This is a great

2
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:11,880
moment not only for our engineering school, the Clark School, but the entire

3
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:16,980
university and the surrounding community. This is a great investment. It's a great

4
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:21,220
investment that the state is happy to be involved with because it's going to

5
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:26,440
change lives. It's going to change the way we live, the generations live. Zupnick Hall

6
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:29,760
will be a new place for engineering students to call home, a place to learn,

7
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,400
to grow, and for students to meet and inspire one another. To emulate the

8
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:39,200
Terrapin, stick our necks out and keep moving forward. Achieving that ambition

9
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,600
means creating an environment that's right for innovation, collaboration,

10
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:48,120
diversity, inclusion, where engineers and non-engineers synergistically connect to

11
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:53,200
find solutions at work. Education remains the most potent force in our country

12
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:58,720
to change lives. By bringing together different departments and centers, our

13
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:03,160
already stellar engineering curriculum will become even stronger. This is one

14
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:08,320
more fantastic addition as we continue to build out the capital of quantum. This

15
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,440
new building is the last piece of the Clark Foundation's building together

16
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:15,920
investment at the university and it's a wonderful capstone to our partnership

17
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,920
with Maryland. Together our investments will cultivate the next generation of

18
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:25,960
engineering leaders. Today, more than ever, our students and engineers in general

19
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:33,200
must have vision. It is my hope that this new space will make it easier to

20
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:38,560
exchange ideas. Having such dedicated friends and partners is a big reason why

21
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:43,320
I'm optimistic about where our campus is today and where it's headed in our

22
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:53,040
future. Three, two, one. It's not enough to just be fearless anymore. We also have

23
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,240
to move fearlessly forward.
