0	7840	Today is a great day. Why? Because today is Stan Lee Zupnick Day. This is a great
7840	11880	moment not only for our engineering school, the Clark School, but the entire
11880	16980	university and the surrounding community. This is a great investment. It's a great
16980	21220	investment that the state is happy to be involved with because it's going to
21220	26440	change lives. It's going to change the way we live, the generations live. Zupnick Hall
26440	29760	will be a new place for engineering students to call home, a place to learn,
29760	34400	to grow, and for students to meet and inspire one another. To emulate the
34400	39200	Terrapin, stick our necks out and keep moving forward. Achieving that ambition
39200	42600	means creating an environment that's right for innovation, collaboration,
42600	48120	diversity, inclusion, where engineers and non-engineers synergistically connect to
48120	53200	find solutions at work. Education remains the most potent force in our country
53480	58720	to change lives. By bringing together different departments and centers, our
58720	63160	already stellar engineering curriculum will become even stronger. This is one
63160	68320	more fantastic addition as we continue to build out the capital of quantum. This
68320	71440	new building is the last piece of the Clark Foundation's building together
71440	75920	investment at the university and it's a wonderful capstone to our partnership
75920	79920	with Maryland. Together our investments will cultivate the next generation of
79960	85960	engineering leaders. Today, more than ever, our students and engineers in general
85960	93200	must have vision. It is my hope that this new space will make it easier to
93200	98560	exchange ideas. Having such dedicated friends and partners is a big reason why
98560	103320	I'm optimistic about where our campus is today and where it's headed in our
103320	113040	future. Three, two, one. It's not enough to just be fearless anymore. We also have
113040	116240	to move fearlessly forward.
