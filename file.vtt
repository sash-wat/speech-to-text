Today is a great day. Why? Because today is Stan Lee Zupnick Day. This is a great

00:07.840 --> 00:11.880
moment not only for our engineering school, the Clark School, but the entire

00:11.880 --> 00:16.980
university and the surrounding community. This is a great investment. It's a great

00:16.980 --> 00:21.220
investment that the state is happy to be involved with because it's going to

00:21.220 --> 00:26.440
change lives. It's going to change the way we live, the generations live. Zupnick Hall

00:26.440 --> 00:29.760
will be a new place for engineering students to call home, a place to learn,

00:29.760 --> 00:34.400
to grow, and for students to meet and inspire one another. To emulate the

00:34.400 --> 00:39.200
Terrapin, stick our necks out and keep moving forward. Achieving that ambition

00:39.200 --> 00:42.600
means creating an environment that's right for innovation, collaboration,

00:42.600 --> 00:48.120
diversity, inclusion, where engineers and non-engineers synergistically connect to

00:48.120 --> 00:53.200
find solutions at work. Education remains the most potent force in our country

00:53.480 --> 00:58.720
to change lives. By bringing together different departments and centers, our

00:58.720 --> 01:03.160
already stellar engineering curriculum will become even stronger. This is one

01:03.160 --> 01:08.320
more fantastic addition as we continue to build out the capital of quantum. This

01:08.320 --> 01:11.440
new building is the last piece of the Clark Foundation's building together

01:11.440 --> 01:15.920
investment at the university and it's a wonderful capstone to our partnership

01:15.920 --> 01:19.920
with Maryland. Together our investments will cultivate the next generation of

01:19.960 --> 01:25.960
engineering leaders. Today, more than ever, our students and engineers in general

01:25.960 --> 01:33.200
must have vision. It is my hope that this new space will make it easier to

01:33.200 --> 01:38.560
exchange ideas. Having such dedicated friends and partners is a big reason why

01:38.560 --> 01:43.320
I'm optimistic about where our campus is today and where it's headed in our

01:43.320 --> 01:53.040
future. Three, two, one. It's not enough to just be fearless anymore. We also have

01:53.040 --> 01:56.240
to move fearlessly forward.
